                <p>Lastlings is the artistic output of sibling duo Amy & Josh Dowdle.</p>
                <p>Self taught musically, the Japanese-Australian pair have devoted to their craft, fine tuning their songwriting and production from their home studio in the hinterlands of Southern Queensland.</p>
                <p>The musical duo formed in July 2015. Releasing two EPs to early acclaim, the duo found themselves having to make a choice between full-time musical pursuit and allowing Amy, then sixteen, to focus on finishing high school. They resisted the pull of the industry, Amy finished her schooling and in 2018 Lastlings returned with new music and the world at their feet. </p>
                <p>Not content with occupying the crowded lane of dreamy electronic pop, Amy and Josh set out to create a live show built around the twin pillars of tension and euphoria. In 2018, the mystique surrounding Lastlings expanded as their live show caught the attention of Australian electronic heavyweights RÜFÜS DU SOL, signing the duo to their newly founded label Rose Avenue Records, and welcoming three substantial singles that included ‘Deja Vu’, ‘I’ve Got You’ and ‘Last Breath’.  </p>
                <p>With new music exposed to the world, in 2020 Lastlings signed a further license deal to Astralwerks in North America and Liberation in Australia, launching into the new decade. As their new sonic direction finds its feet the Lastlings live show continues to be reimagined,  oscillating between anguish and bliss, with compositions designed to transcend. In March, Lastlings welcomed ‘Take My Hand’ off their eagerly anticipated debut album, a surging electronic track, furthering their unique conceptual space. Remix efforts from Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Torrent Foot further encapsulated the aura this track radiates. Next up is ‘No Time’, a hauntingly beautiful track debuted on Untitled Group’s Virtual Day Party stream from the historic Old Melbourne Gaol. </p>
                <p>Previously selling out Australian headline tours, supporting the likes of Two Door Cinema Club and RÜFÜS DU SOL, while earning spots on esteemed music events; Coachella’s DoLaB and Splendour In The Grass and Beyond The Valley, Amy and Josh are no strangers to the world’s biggest stages. Lastlings start a new chapter in what is set to be a bright future following in the steps of one of Australia’s biggest dance exports. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Lastlings will welcome their debut album 'First Contact' on Nov 20. See you soon x</p>
